Weather app
You can tell from its funny and lazy name that its a weather app (duhh!!)

I built this to test my skills in design and api consuming and I think I did a pretty good job.

Basically, Its a web app that shows you the current and forecast weather conditions of a city.
-You can search for over 100,000 cities.
-See some basic conditions for the next 4 more days.
-See the hourly forecast of the day(plan your day and confirm with the weather)

I will continue to add more usability and responsiveness, but for now it only supports the desktop view
